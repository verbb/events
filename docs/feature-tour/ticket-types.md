# Ticket Types

Ticket types act to group your Tickets, and depending on your needs, you may only require a single ticket type. Custom fields can be added to ticket types, providing each individual ticket product additional fields.

Go to the main section for Events in your control panel main menu, and select **Ticket Types**. This will list all the ticket types you've created.

The **Delete** icon deletes already created ticket types. Created tickets for this ticket type will also be deleted. Already purchased tickets still remain in the database.

### Create a Ticket Type

Each field is fairly self-explanatory, but any additional information is provided below.
